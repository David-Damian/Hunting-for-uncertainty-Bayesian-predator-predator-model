# Hunting-for-uncertainty-Bayesian-predator-predator-model
Combining the power of bayesian statistics and dynamical systems theory, here is present a interesting application in real world of bayesian workflow.

Based on [Carpenter, B. 2018](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/lotka-volterra-predator-prey.html) I have improved and added originality to the Bayesian workflow presented. This was achieved by including additional steps, such as simulation-based calibration, in addition
forecasting and backcasting, and a detailed analysis of the dynamic system defined by [Lotka-Volterra equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations).
